Java final project proposal

Multi dice games
Wes Allen

This project is a multi-game application. It consists of a main menu with choices of various games. The games you can choose from are a variety of simple dice games, such as Pig or Crown and anchor.

The target audience would consist of anyone who wants to pass time and relieve boredom. For example, someone waiting in a doctor’s or a dentist’s office for an appointment, or anyone waiting for someone who is in their appointment. This project would also appeal to anyone who is a fan of simple games or dice games. It can be played by yourself or with a friend of group of friends. The games are simple with easy to understand rules.

To provide a broader appeal I will be including multiple games into one application. There will be games that appeal to all ages young and old. They can be enjoyed alone or with friends. I will also be providing a simple easy to use, user friendly interface. This application will have eye appealing graphics. 

This project is unique in that It provides multiple games in one. Many of the dice games on the market are only one game, or a simple roller that only rolls the dice without the game structure. I was inspired by one of my favorite mobile apps that is a simple solitaire platform, it allows the user to choose from a list of varied solitaire games all within one application. This would be similar but with dice games rather than solitaire card games.

I believe this application would be helpful in that it helps to alleviate boredom as well as stress in daily life. By providing a fun simple way to distract you from the monotony of daily life. Such as waiting rooms. As a passenger in an automobile, or being on hold waiting for busy customer service representatives like the IRS during tax season. 

Possible bugs I have yet to come up with a plan to address include allowing the user to be able to choose a number of possible human of computer opponents while still maintaining a decent aspect ratio to the various components within the user interface. And maintaining am eye appealing interface without either too much clutter for more players, or too much empty space for less users. As well as figuring out how to provide a competent computer opponent for a single user.

I would lie to move forward with this project because I believe it will be both enjoyable to use as well as rewarding to have accomplished. I myself enjoy simple games like this that I can play both with friends or by myself while waiting for something like in the doctor’s or dentist’s office I mentioned earlier. I plan to make one dice roller witch all of the various games will draw from. I will begin with a main menu where you can choose your game of choice from. I will then begin adding all of the individual games. I plan on creating the following games: Cho Han, Crown and Anchor, High Low, Pig, and LCR to begin with, and would possibly like to add more if possible down the line.
